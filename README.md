**Modi** is a fast-paced multiplayer card game inspired by the classic "Pass the Ace." Swap cards, dodge the dreaded Ace, and outsmart your friends to be the last player standing.

## Play Anywhere

- **Web** – Enjoy Modi right in your browser. The game is built with Expo and optimized for modern desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Mobile** – Play on iOS or Android. Scan the Expo QR code during development or look for upcoming releases on the App Store and Google Play.

## How to Play

1. Each player starts with one face-down card and three lives.
2. On your turn, choose to **Stick** with your card or **Swap** with the player on your left.
3. Kings are untouchable—if you try to swap with one, it's a **Kung**.
4. After swapping:
   - If your new card is lower, that's a **Modi**.
   - If it's the same rank, it's a **Dirty Dan**.
5. When everyone has taken a turn, reveal the cards. Anyone holding the lowest card loses a life.
6. Lose all three lives and you're out. The last player standing wins!
